                <p>
                    Hannah Lowe is a British-Jamaican female poet. She was born an only-child, dealt a rough hand to play. This website aims to inform the reader of the impact that Hannah has given to the world in her poems, such as discussions of racism, sexism, and giving silent voices a platform on which to speak. Hannah’s poems offer a frame of reference for future writers that aspire to be like her or even better. We will explore the aspects of her character and works as this writing continues.

                    Hannah was born in Illford, Essex in 1976 and studied American literature at the University of Sussex and went on to teach creative writing at Oxford Brookes University. Hannah began writing poetry at the age 29 after the passing of her father and used poetry as a means of coping and expressing her stress of the loss, which was most notably the biggest influence on her writing since her poems generally speak of her family. Her poems reflected her life and how she experienced it.                 </p>

                    <h3>Sausages</h3>
                    <img src="img/1p.PNG" alt="p1">
                    <p>The poem sausages are an example of some of the troubles Hannah’s father went through. From a first glance, the poem seems to show a female having a male partner who is different from other people. This male partner is also distained by the speaker’s mother. Doesn’t take a genius to tell this poem seems to focus on prejudices, racism, and immigration (possibly). Some lines that tell us this in the poem are some like, stanza 2 lines 2-3, “Her mother told her not to marry a foreigner.”. This line shows that the male partner is a foreigner, which shows how these themes work. Now that we’ve established what themes are in the poems, let’s figure out how this applies to Hannah’s life. Who do we know in Hannah’s life who possible faced some form of racism? This would be her father. Hannah’s father is a Chinese-Jamaican man, which makes him susceptible to racism in the place they lived, Illinois. The poem seems to focus about Hannah’s relationship with her father and how they delt with racism due to ethnicity. </p>

                    <h3>Fishes</h3>
                    <img src="img/3p.PNG" alt="p2">
                    <p>This poem is a tragic one, telling the tale of the death of Hannah’s father and how she has learnt to cope with it through her writing. As shown in the lines ”your daddy dying girl” and “I see your brain cells then, a thousand small fishes, crossing the ocean” which implies that his greatness and the greatness of his body’s resilience will live on in her family’s and friends’ memory. Another aspect of the poem to be mentioned is its shape & structure. The poem is shaped like a river or a pool of water of the sort, which is a smart call-back to the name of the poem. In conclusion the poem talks about a tragedy that influenced Hannah Lowe writing and life, as she expresses her feelings, appreciation, and loss to vent out certain thoughts or coping tropes via poetry.</p>
