            <div class="bioText">
                <p>
                    Hannah Lowe is a British-Jamaican female poet. She was born an only-child, dealt a rough hand to play. This website aims to inform the reader of the impact that Hannah has given to the world in her poems, such as discussions of racism, sexism, and giving silent voices a platform on which to speak. Hannah’s poems offer a frame of reference for future writers that aspire to be like her or even better. We will explore the aspects of her character and works as this writing continues.

                    Hannah was born in Illford, Essex in 1976 and studied American literature at the University of Sussex and went on to teach creative writing at Oxford Brookes University. Hannah began writing poetry at the age 29 after the passing of her father and used poetry as a means of coping and expressing her stress of the loss, which was most notably the biggest influence on her writing since her poems generally speak of her family. Her poems reflected her life and how she experienced it.                 </p>

                    <h3>Sausages</h3>
                    <img src="img/1p.PNG" alt="p1">
                    <p>The poem sausages are an example of some of the troubles Hannah’s father went through. From a first glance, the poem seems to show a female having a male partner who is different from other people. This male partner is also distained by the speaker’s mother. Doesn’t take a genius to tell this poem seems to focus on prejudices, racism, and immigration (possibly). Some lines that tell us this in the poem are some like, stanza 2 lines 2-3, “Her mother told her not to marry a foreigner.”. This line shows that the male partner is a foreigner, which shows how these themes work. Now that we’ve established what themes are in the poems, let’s figure out how this applies to Hannah’s life. Who do we know in Hannah’s life who possible faced some form of racism? This would be her father. Hannah’s father is a Chinese-Jamaican man, which makes him susceptible to racism in the place they lived, Illinois. The poem seems to focus about Hannah’s relationship with her father and how they delt with racism due to ethnicity. </p>

                    <h3>Fishes</h3>
                    <img src="img/3p.PNG" alt="p2">
                    <p>This poem is a tragic one, telling the tale of the death of Hannah’s father and how she has learnt to cope with it through her writing. As shown in the lines ”your daddy dying girl” and “I see your brain cells then, a thousand small fishes, crossing the ocean” which implies that his greatness and the greatness of his body’s resilience will live on in her family’s and friends’ memory. Another aspect of the poem to be mentioned is its shape & structure. The poem is shaped like a river or a pool of water of the sort, which is a smart call-back to the name of the poem. In conclusion the poem talks about a tragedy that influenced Hannah Lowe writing and life, as she expresses her feelings, appreciation, and loss to vent out certain thoughts or coping tropes via poetry.</p>

                    <h3>Stowaway</h3>
                    <img src="img/p32.PNG" alt="p2">
                    <p>The poem “Stowaway” is a poem that goes to talk about an experience Hannah Lowe had in her life. When we look at the poem, at first glance (or read), we can see what it’s talking about quite well. The poem seems to be talking about how refugee lives in a ship. Based on all the lines of being poor, such as in stanza 3, lines 2-4, “and had no gold or pearls to pawn, no cow or goat to sell - but as we’d hands, we'd work,” is a line that shows that they had to work to stay on the ship. Now you could say “Well, why refugees? Why not just any poor people?”, and to this I say, nay, I ask thine, who wrote this poem? Hannah Lowe wrote this poem. Hannah usually writes poems to expresses (usually) some things that she went through in her life. Hannah has a degree in Refugee studies, which means she’s very knowledgeable about them. Considering the problems her father probably faced when going to other countries, she may have decided to learn more about refugees. And what better way to showcase her emotions for them than through a poem. The message Hannah Lowe was trying to convey in this poem (probably) is how bad refugees get it. As mentioned earlier, they may have to work to stay on ship. These ones in the poem were fed by donations, and they had to jump off the boat and swim. This is according to stanza 4, lines 1-3, “And we were fed by kindness - serviettes of scrap, old bread, some fleshy bones.” And stanza 5, “and when at last the docks on England's rim rose up, what choice had we but to jump and swim?” This poem how’s how badly the refugees had it and what I believe Hannah Lowe is trying to show.</p>

                    <h3>Ormode</h3>
                    <img src="img/p4.PNG" alt="p2">
                    <p>The poem Ormonde talks about the difficulties that Hannah Lowe’s dad went through while migrating on the ship he says that they left from Kingston town and the “ormonde sails”.  Hannah Lowe’s dad says that everyone that was migrating felt bad because they were leaving their family and loved ones back at home and that everyone is going through a hard time to try finding a better job and provide a better lifestyle for their family. Hannah Lowe’s dad said that him playing cards for fun on the boat was where he learned to gamble and he described the ormonde as a “slimy timber below the albert dock” all the passenger’s step from the ship through coverlet of mist in conclusion the poem is describing the state of everyone that migrates and the difficulties they went through and, how and where Hannah Lowe’s dad learned to gamble.</p>

                    <h3>Three Treasures</h3>
                    <img src="img/p5.PNG" alt="p2">
                    <p>Within the “Three Treasures” poem, it discusses the ethnicity and backgrounds of the countries which Hannah Lowe originates from. The poem showcases the stereotypical lives of the people of England, Jamaica, and China. This ties into how Hannah’s ethnicity, appreciating and being prideful of the countries she originates from. The activities of each of the countries being stereotypical is possibly implying that Hannah faced discrimination from people who didn’t take kindly to her origins or parents.</p>
